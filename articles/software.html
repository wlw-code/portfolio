        <h2 class="article-title">Operating systems</h2>
        
        <h3 class="article-title">Linux</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I use two different Linux distributions. On my main PC, I enjoy gaming in my free time, so I use <a href="https://linuxmint.com" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> 20.1. It suits my use case while avoiding the hell that is Windows and things I don't like about Canonical (and Ubuntu by extension), namely their attempts to 'corporatise' Linux, their push for Snaps, and their "Ubuntu Software Store" which is scarily similar to the walled gardens of the Mac OS app store.</p>
        <p class="article-text">On my laptop, which is primarily for work, I use <a href="https://artixlinux.org" target="_blank">Artix Linux</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">. Artix is essentially Arch without systemd. I don't hate systemd, I just prefer runit, though I have not tried OpenRC or s6 which are two other init systems offered in a base install of Artix.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Really, you can accomplish anything with any Linux distribution, with enough time and patience. I would tend to recommend Arch-based distros above all others, though I suppose personal preference trumps all.</p>
        <h3 class="article-title">Windows</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I have a Windows dual-boot on my laptop and PC for the occasions where a piece of software demands it, or I need to use .NET Framework for something. Other than that, I don't touch it.</p>
        
        <h2 class="article-title">Utilities</h2>
        
        <h3 class="article-title"><a href="https://suckless.org" target="_blank">Suckless</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> tools</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I use <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org" target="_blank">DWM</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> (dynamic window manager) as my window manager of choice on my laptop. DWM is infinitely customisable by its very nature. You are intended to overwrite, modify, and extend the source code to fit your individual needs, or install extra features others have already made for you. All Suckless offer is the base code and an empty palette for you to work on.</p>
        <p class="article-text">My terminal emulator of choice is <a href="https://st.suckless.org" target="_blank">ST</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> (simple terminal). Like DWM, it is made by Suckless and is also offered as a modifiable base upon which to build your own release.</p>
    
        <h3 class="article-title">Web browser</h3>
        <p class="article-text"><a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">, I believe, is the best web browser out there at the moment. It's fast, contains almost every privacy feature after changing a couple of settings, supports web extensions for Chrome, and is fully open-source. Chromium is okay, though I would recommend <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium" target="_blank">Ungoogled Chromium</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> over the normal version, but Brave is the simplest solution.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I used to use <a href="https://mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">, but it relies on Google's money, and Mozilla has increasingly abandoned their routes as of late. It's still a decent option for a browser, and the biggest non-Chromium based browser left, but it's falling behind in terms of speed.</p>
    
        <h3 class="article-title">Text editors</h3>
        <p class="article-text">For all-purpose text editing and automation I use <a href="https://www.vim.org" target="_blank">Vim</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">. Vim is great. It's lightweight, powerful, terminal based, and is very efficient when you learn to use it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">For coding projects that don't require a full IDE, <a href="https://vscodium.com/" target="_blank">VSCodium</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> is my go-to. If Degoogled Chromium is Chromium without Google, VSCodium Demicrosofted VS Code. VS Code <em>is</em> open-source, but the binary download available on MS' website is closed-source, and contains Microsoft's telemetry (data collection). VSCodium takes the great features of VS Code and strips the spookiness out of it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Lastly, my IDE of choice is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank">JetBrains Rider</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">. It, unfortunately, isn't open-source. It also isn't free, but it is available on Linux, and I get it for free as a student. If a fully-featured, free and open-source .NET IDE becomes available, I will likely switch to it. </p>
    
        <h3 class="article-title">Multimedia</h3>
        <p class="article-text">The single best image viewer on Linux is <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv" target="_blank">SXIV</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]"> (Simple X Image Viewer). It's feature-rich, extremely lightweight, very fast, and fully open-source.</p>
        <p class="article-text">There are lots of options for video players, but the one I use is <a href="https://mpv.io/" target="_blank">mpv</a><img src="../assets/external.png" alt="[EXT]">. Terminal-based, fast, open-source. I've always had technical issues with VLC, and I have no need for the advanced features, so I don't use it.</p>
