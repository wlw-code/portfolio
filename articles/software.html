        <h1>Software I use</h1>
        <p><em>You can click any book &#128214 icon to read the full article.</em></p>

        <h2 class="article-title">Operating systems</h2>
        
        <h3 class="article-title">Linux</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I use two different Linux distributions. On my main PC, I enjoy gaming in my free time, so I use <span class="article-emphasis">Linux Mint</span> 20.1. It suits my use case and I love the freedom and flexibility Linux provides, as well as the community built around it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">On my laptop, which is primarily for work, I use <span class="article-emphasis">Artix Linux</span>. Artix is essentially Arch without systemd. I don't hate systemd, I just prefer runit, though I have not tried OpenRC or s6 which are two other init systems offered in a base install of Artix.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Really, you can accomplish anything with any Linux distribution, with enough time and patience. I would tend to recommend Arch-based distros above all others, though I suppose personal preference trumps all.</p>
        <h3 class="article-title">Windows</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I have a Windows dual-boot on my laptop and PC for the occasions where I need to use software such as .NET Framework which is not supported on Linux.</p>
        
        <h2 class="article-title">Utilities</h2>
        
        <h3 class="article-title">Suckless tools</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I use <span class="article-emphasis">DWM</span> (dynamic window manager) as my window manager of choice on my laptop. DWM is infinitely customisable by its very nature. You are intended to overwrite, modify, and extend the source code to fit your individual needs, or install extra features others have already made for you. All Suckless offer is the base code and an empty palette for you to work on.</p>
        <p class="article-text">My terminal emulator of choice is <span class="article-emphasis">ST</span> (simple terminal). Like DWM, it is made by Suckless and is also offered as a modifiable base upon which to build your own release.</p>
    
        <h3 class="article-title">Web browser</h3>
        <p class="article-text"><span class="article-emphasis">Brave</span>, I believe, is the best web browser out there at the moment. It's fast, contains almost every privacy feature after changing a couple of settings, supports web extensions for Chrome, and is fully open-source. Brave strikes the perfect balance between solid privacy, great speed, and ease-of-use.</p>
        
        <h3 class="article-title">Text editors</h3>
        <p class="article-text">For all-purpose text editing and automation I use <span class="article-emphasis">Vim</span>. Vim is great. It's lightweight, powerful, terminal based, and is very efficient when you learn to use it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">For coding projects that don't require a full IDE, <span class="article-emphasis">VSCodium</span> is my go-to. It's a totally open-source fork of VS Code with better privacy. Awesome! VS Code <em>is</em> open-source, but the binary download available on MS' website is closed-source, and contains Microsoft's telemetry (usage data collection).</p>
        <p class="article-text">Lastly, my IDE of choice is <span class="article-emphasis">JetBrains Rider</span>. It, unfortunately, isn't open-source. It also isn't free, but it is available on Linux, works very well, and I get it for free as a student. If a fully-featured, free and open-source .NET IDE becomes available, I will likely switch to it. </p>
    
        <h3 class="article-title">Multimedia</h3>
        <p class="article-text">The single best image viewer on Linux is <span class="article-emphasis">SXIV</span> (Simple X Image Viewer). It's feature-rich, extremely lightweight, very fast, and fully open-source.</p>
        <p class="article-text">There are lots of options for video players, but the one I use is <span class="article-emphasis">mpv</span>. Terminal-based, fast, open-source. I've always had technical issues with VLC, and I have no need for the advanced features, so I don't use it.</p>
        <p class="article-text">My music player of choice is <span class="article-emphasis">MOC</span> (Music On Console). It has a tonne of useful features, namely the ability to detach the player from the server while keeping it playing in the background, play from URL, create playlists, show lyrics, and much more, all in a console-based application that runs very quickly.</p>
        
        <h3 class="article-title">Creative production</h3>
        <p class="article-text">I feel like <span class="article-emphasis">GIMP</span> (GNU Image Manipulation Program) needs no introduction as the free, open-source, cross-platform version of Photoshop. I use it for most editing projects, but I also use ImageMagick for quick changes like image format conversions.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The best Linux video editor is <span class="article-emphasis">Kdenlive</span>, without a doubt. It's FOSS, fast, and powerful.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I've used <span class="article-emphasis">Audacity</span> for years and it has always done a great job for me.</p>
